    <h1>Executive Business Overview - Carrot Application</h1>

    <p>The Carrot Application is a financial management platform designed to automate and streamline invoice, supplier, and payment operations for businesses handling high volumes of financial documents, particularly in sectors like fuel supply. Its core purpose is to eliminate the inefficiencies, errors, and lack of real-time visibility inherent in manual financial processing.</p>

    <h2>Project Purpose & Core Problem Solved</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Target Users/Audience</h2>
    <p>The primary beneficiaries are internal business stakeholders responsible for financial health and operational efficiency. This includes Financial Controllers, Accounts Payable teams, Procurement departments, and Operations Managers who require precise tracking and reconciliation of expenditures, as well as Senior Management seeking consolidated financial insights.</p>

    <h2>High-Level Functional Capabilities (Business Perspective)</h2>

        <li><b>Visual Workflow Tracking:</b> Provides an interactive Kanban board displaying invoices in various processing stages (e.g., "Imported," "Checked," "Client Approval Needed," "Approved for Payment"), enabling seamless status updates.</li>
        <li><b>Automated Transaction Reconciliation:</b> Automatically matches transaction data (e.g., from bank feeds or fuel cards) against corresponding invoice line items, flagging discrepancies and providing a detailed reconciliation status.</li>
        <li><b>Multi-Currency Support:</b> Processes invoices and payments in multiple foreign currencies, automatically converting amounts to a standardized base currency (e.g., EUR) using daily exchange rates.</li>
