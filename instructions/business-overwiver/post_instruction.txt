Having meticulously processed all provided source code and existing documentation from the project, you are now at the final stage of your mission as the expert AI Business Analyst. Your task is to deliver the **Executive Business Overview** you were primed to create.

**Your single, crucial response must be a JSON array representing file operations.** This operation will either be to create a brand-new `business_overview.html` if one does not exist or if the project has fundamentally changed, or to update the existing `business_overview.html` to reflect the latest project state and insights derived from the new code/documentation.

**IMPORTANT**: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting in your response.

The JSON structure must be an array of objects, where each object has:
- "operation": either "create", "update", or "delete"
- "file_path": the relative path for the file (e.g., "overview.html", "api/string-processor.html")
- "file_content": the complete HTML content for the file (required for "create" and "update" operations)

Example JSON structure:
[
  {
    "operation": "create",
    "file_path": "project_overview.html",
    "file_content": "<html><head><title>Project Overview</title></head><body><h1>Project Overview</h1><p>This project contains...</p></body></html>"
  },
  {
    "operation": "update",
    "file_path": "api_documentation.html",
    "file_content": "<html><head><title>API Documentation</title></head><body><h1>API Documentation</h1><p>Updated content...</p></body></html>"
  },
  {
    "operation": "delete",
    "file_path": "outdated_file.html"
  }
]

Requirements for HTML content:
- Use simple, clean HTML with basic tags: <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <code>, <pre>
- Include proper page titles
- Structure content with clear headings
- Provide practical code examples where appropriate
- Make the documentation comprehensive and useful for developers

Remember: Respond with ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
