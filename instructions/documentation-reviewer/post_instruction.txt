Your final task is to deliver a **Documentation Review Report** as a single, raw HTML file. This file must contain a dedicated, structured section for each inconsistency or logical error you identified.

**Your entire response must be ONLY the HTML content.** Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting. The response must start with `<html>` and end with `</html>`.

**The HTML structure is critical and you must follow it strictly:**
1.  A `<head>` section with a `<title>` for the entire document (e.g., "Documentation Review Report"). The filename will be generated from this title.
2.  A `<body>` containing an `<h1>` for the document title.
3.  If no issues are found, the body should contain a single `<p>` tag with the text: "No inconsistencies or logical errors were found in the documentation."
4.  If issues are found, for **each** issue, create a dedicated `<div class="issue-container">` with:
    *   An `<h2>` describing the issue concisely (e.g., "Inconsistent Entity Reference").
    *   An `<h3>` with the text "Problem Details".
    *   A `<p>` with a detailed explanation of the problem, including references to the specific documents or sections that are in conflict.
    *   An `<h3>` with the text "Suggested Solution".
    *   A `<p>` with a clear, actionable suggestion for how to resolve the inconsistency.

**Example of a valid response structure with an issue:**
```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Documentation Review Report</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Documentation Review Report</h1>

    <div class="issue-container">
        <h2>Inconsistent Entity Reference</h2>
        <h3>Problem Details</h3>
        <p>The "Backend APIs" documentation for the "CreateOrder" function references a "ShippingDetails" entity. However, the "Domain Entities" documentation does not define a "ShippingDetails" entity. It only defines a "CustomerAddress" entity.</p>
        <h3>Suggested Solution</h3>
        <p>Verify if "ShippingDetails" is a distinct entity that needs to be added to the Domain Entities document, or if the "CreateOrder" function should be updated to use the existing "CustomerAddress" entity instead.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- ... other issue divs would follow here ... -->
</body>
</html>
```

**Remember: Respond with ONLY the raw HTML content for your report, strictly following the specified structure.**
