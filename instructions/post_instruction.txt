Based on your analysis of the provided source code and existing documentation, you must respond with a JSON array of file operations. Each operation should create, update, or delete documentation files.

**IMPORTANT**: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting in your response.

The JSON structure must be an array of objects, where each object has:
- "operation": either "create", "update", or "delete"
- "file_path": the relative path for the file (e.g., "overview.html", "api/string-processor.html")
- "file_content": the complete HTML content for the file (required for "create" and "update" operations)

Example JSON structure:
[
  {
    "operation": "create",
    "file_path": "project_overview.html",
    "file_content": "<html><head><title>Project Overview</title></head><body><h1>Project Overview</h1><p>This project contains...</p></body></html>"
  },
  {
    "operation": "update",
    "file_path": "api_documentation.html",
    "file_content": "<html><head><title>API Documentation</title></head><body><h1>API Documentation</h1><p>Updated content...</p></body></html>"
  },
  {
    "operation": "delete",
    "file_path": "outdated_file.html"
  }
]

Requirements for HTML content:
- Use simple, clean HTML with basic tags: <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <code>, <pre>
- Include proper page titles
- Structure content with clear headings
- Provide practical code examples where appropriate
- Make the documentation comprehensive and useful for developers

Remember: Respond with ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
