Your final task is to deliver a complete **External Integrations Documentation** as a single, raw HTML file. This file must contain a dedicated, structured section for each distinct external integration you identified.

**Your entire response must be ONLY the HTML content.** Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting. The response must start with `<html>` and end with `</html>`.

**The HTML structure is critical and you must follow it strictly:**
1.  A `<head>` section with a `<title>` for the entire document (e.g., "External Integrations"). The filename will be generated from this title.
2.  A `<body>` containing an `<h1>` for the document title.
3.  For **each** integration, a dedicated `<div class="integration-container">` with:
    *   An `id` attribute for internal linking (e.g., `id="stripe-payment-gateway"`).
    *   An `<h2>` with the integration name.
    *   A `<p>` with a brief description of its purpose.
    *   An `<h3>` with the text "Details".
    *   A `<table>` with the following rows: `Authentication Method`, `Key Endpoints/Methods`, `Error Handling`.
    *   An `<h3>` with the text "Data Sent".
    *   A `<table>` listing the data sent to the integration. Columns: `Parameter`, `Type`, `Description`.
    *   An `<h3>` with the text "Data Received".
    *   A `<table>` listing the data received from the integration. Columns: `Parameter`, `Type`, `Description`.

**Example of a valid response structure:**
```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>External Integrations</title>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Data Sent</h3>

                    <td>string</td>
                    <td>The status of the charge (e.g., "succeeded", "failed").</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    <!-- ... other integration divs would follow here ... -->
</body>
</html>
