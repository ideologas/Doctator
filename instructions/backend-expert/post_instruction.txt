Your final task is to deliver a complete **Backend APIs and Functions Documentation** as a single, raw HTML file. This file must contain a dedicated, structured section for each distinct function or API endpoint you identified.

**Your entire response must be ONLY the HTML content.** Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting. The response must start with `<html>` and end with `</html>`.

**The HTML structure is critical and you must follow it strictly:**
1.  A `<head>` section with a `<title>` for the entire document (e.g., "Backend APIs and Functions"). The filename will be generated from this title.
2.  A `<body>` containing an `<h1>` for the document title.
3.  For **each** function/API, a dedicated `<div class="function-container">` with:
    *   An `id` attribute for internal linking, matching the function's name (e.g., `id="check-external-session"`).
    *   An `<h2>` containing the unique and descriptive name of the function or endpoint (e.g., "Check for External User Session"). This is a change from the previous "Overview" heading.
    *   A `<table>` for the function's high-level description.
        *   **Rows:** `Type` (e.g., "Backend", "API Endpoint"), `Description`.
    *   An `<h3>` with the text "Implementation Requirements".
    *   A `<table>` for the detailed implementation logic.
        *   **Columns:** `No.`, `Description`.
        *   The `Description` column should detail the function's algorithm and may contain `<ul>` and `<li>` elements for clarity.
        *   **Crucially**, you must link to entities and concepts from the provided documentation where relevant (e.g., `In case <a href="entities/user-session.html">User session</a> was created...`).

**Example of a valid response structure:**
```html

<head>
    <title>Backend APIs and Functions</title>
